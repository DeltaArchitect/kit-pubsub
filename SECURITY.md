## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you find a vulnerability, please report it via **GitHub Security Advisories** by using the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab (if enabled) or by contacting the maintainer directly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Process

We will try to review your report as soon as possible.
